# My C Synthesizer
This is my own little digital synthesizer in C.
It is based on [this tutorial](https://blog.demofox.org/2012/05/14/diy-synthesizer-chapter-1-sound-output/) by Alan Wolfe which uses C++.

## Compile and run
```C
make
./synth
```
or
```
make run
```
You will now find several example programs (`*.wav`) in the project's root directory.
